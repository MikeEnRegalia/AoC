# advent-of-code

TBH, I don't really spend a lot of time on making this repo as clean as it maybe should be. 
It is a haphazard collection of my AoC solutions over the years,
and it gets the job done. Maybe I'll manage to find the time to clean it up in 2023, but
truth be told, I'll probably be more busy working on my music website, which I just re-launched (January 2023) using 
lots of shiny state-of-the-art technologies, including nx, next.js, react, TypeScript, Apollo, GraphQL, ktorm, PostgreSQL ... 
and of course the greatest language of them all: 

*Kotlin* :D !

Check out the website and listen to some great music while we're all waiting for Advent of Code 2023!
